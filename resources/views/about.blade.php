                        <h4>For Clients</h4>
                        <p>Why book through us? Because we are bringing the choice to you. We want to make it easy for you to find the best local photographers in your city. An assortment of the most talented photographers, their specialisms and their availability. A community of people that love to capture everything from that special proposal, that new image for your brochure or even that fashion blog you always wanted to start. Our aim is to make finding a photographer simple - no matter what the occasion.</p>

                        <h4>For Photographers</h4>
                        <p>Why sign up with us? We’ve all heard the cliché – ‘do what you love or love what you do’. For most of us, photography started as a hobby that we eventually wished to make our career. The only problem is that finding clients can be tough.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Signing up to be a Photographer helps to alleviate this problem, bringing the clients to you. Whether you’re a master food photographer, or love capturing those special moments - there are categories for everyone. The best part, is we let you choose the prices, unlike some other photography websites (we don’t like naming names).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Maybe you already are established in your city, but quite fancy the idea of a few weeks in Paris? Why not create a listing there and have a working holiday! Having the idea is one thing, having the platform to do it is another. And that’s where we come in.</p>
